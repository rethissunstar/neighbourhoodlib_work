# Neighbourhood Library 

## Description

We created a neighbourhood library service. Users can register as a member of the neighbourhood, then both offer their books to be lent and review what books their neighbours have available for them to borrow. 

The site will help foster a community within a neighbourhood, and bring people together over a common passion for reading.

Future expansion goals include:
 
- expand to multiple neighbourhoods
- address validation

## Tech Used

- Express
- Node
- Heroku
- Bootstrap
- QR Codes
- node-qrcode

## Usage

File can used and shared to for knowledge expansion or general use as required.
